# Devlog — Flyer to Table

Newest entries first. One entry per completed task/change set.

## 2026-07-23 — ② Shopping mode: "All my stores" vs "One store" (multi stays default)
- New "Shopping trip" control on the Shopping List: segmented toggle; single mode shows per-store chips with one-stop totals for the current plan, sorted cheapest-first (the picker IS the comparison — e.g. Loblaws $236.12 … Provigo $273.95), plus a footer delta vs all-stores and "Sale prices exact; other items estimated."
- Enforcement at ONE choke point (buildPlanContext narrows selectedStoreIds) so generation, costing, swaps, and the list all obey the mode; PricingResolver/buildShoppingList untouched. Multi-store aggregation (drive-around max savings) unchanged and default, per Jon.
- Additive prefs (shoppingMode/singleStoreId — old persisted prefs hydrate as multi); invalid single store falls back to multi with a LOUD banner; list reprices reactively on toggle (add-store precedent), plan totals stay as-generated with a regenerate hint.
- Verified live: one-store Loblaws collapses to a single 17-item group at $236.12 with its sale prices; chips show all 7 candidates' totals.
- Tests: 195 → 215. Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (pass).

## 2026-07-23 — ① Price-plausibility validation layer (all three pipelines)
- New shared band (data-derived from real extractions + seeds): sale-vs-base-regular ratio in canonical units; [0.30–1.50] ok, outside [0.15–3.0] rejected, between = flagged 'suspicious'. Would have caught all three of tonight's incidents by economics alone.
- Policy per pipeline: extract-flyer (v6) keeps suspicious deals flagged for human review; discover-deals (v3) drops non-ok before the shared deal_cache; client PricingResolver hard-rejects as last line vs stale overlays. Confirm panel shows suspicious rows warning-styled, default-EXCLUDED, live re-classify on edit ("flag low-confidence rather than surface bad data" — spec P0).
- Clean-beats-cheaper-suspicious dedupe; server plausibility.ts copies byte-identical + sync-tested against src/data/pricing.ts and src/domain/priceBand.ts.
- Live re-verify (real Maxi PDF, v6): 15 deals, zero false rejects (chicken $1.99/lb survives), 2 EARNED flags — milk "$4.88/L" (actually a 2L carton → $2.44/L) and rice $14.99 (8 kg bag vs standard bag). Both are real package-size ambiguities routed to human review.
- Tests: 164 → 195. Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (pass). Next: ② one-stop vs multi-store shopping mode (multi-store stays default per Jon).

## 2026-07-23 — Direction discussion: systematic validation + single-store mode (no code)
- Jon: backend should verify units AND pricing logic before data reaches recipes/lists; want a one-store vs multi-store shopping option; flagged that non-flyer ingredients need pricing (maybe via online-grocer data).
- Assessment: (①) add a price-plausibility band using BASE_PRICES (sale within ~30–150% of known regular in canonical units — would have caught all three of tonight's incidents), flag borderline deals into the existing confirm/edit panel per the spec's low-confidence P0 requirement, and consolidate the thrice-copied unit gate into one shared validation module. (②) one-stop toggle is buildable NOW — base prices already fill non-flyer ingredients; richer version compares plan cost per store ("one-stop at Maxi $172 vs multi-store $158"). (③) per-store real price book from grocer catalog APIs (IGA Algolia etc., per Phase 0) is the Phase 2 upgrade that makes single-store totals exact; same ToS/bot-wall posture as flyers.
- Recommended order: ① validation → ② one-stop toggle → ③ price book (defer until pilot demand proven). Awaiting Jon's go.

## Backlog additions
- Price-plausibility validation layer (①) — trust foundation.
- One-stop vs multi-store toggle + per-store cost comparison (② — spec P1 item).
- Per-store price book via grocer catalog APIs (③ — Phase 2).

## 2026-07-23 — Bug fix: $6,495 shrimp ("500 pack") — client-side unit gate
- Reported: "500 pack × $12.99 = $6,495.00" for shrimp. Price was right; unit wasn't. A pre-gate Super C extraction ('pack'-priced shrimp on the per-gram ingredient) persisted in the user's overlay, and the client's reconcileQtyToPricingUnit passes quantities through in prod on mass↔non-mass mismatch — relabeling 500 g as 500 packs.
- Fix: the SAME unit-compatibility gate now lives client-side in PricingResolver's candidate selection (exact unit match OR both mass) — so stale caches/overlays and any future data source can't produce absurd lines. Incompatible deals are ignored; the ingredient prices at its honest base price, off-sale. reconcileQtyToPricingUnit's loud guard untouched.
- All three layers now share identical gate semantics: discover-deals (server), extract-flyer (server), PricingResolver (client last line of defense).
- User remedy for stale data: re-upload the affected store's flyer (replaces the overlay) — or the client gate now neutralizes it automatically once deployed.
- Tests: 159 → 164. Pipeline: code-builder → reviewer (pass).

## 2026-07-23 — Bug fix: $2,385 shrimp (unit-mismatch pricing in extract-flyer)
- Reported: real Maxi upload showed "Raw shrimp skewers 300g — 500 g × $477.00/100 g = $2,385.00". Flyer price was $4.77 PER SKEWER; the validator's unknown-unit fallback stamped it onto shrimp's canonical per-GRAM unit.
- Fix: ported discover-deals' unit-correctness gate into extract-flyer/validate.ts — keep a deal only when its unit exactly matches the ingredient's canonical unit OR both are mass units; unknown units never fall back to a mass canonical. Cost-correctness beats deal count: package-priced items mapped to mass-canonical ingredients are dropped, not guessed.
- Re-verified with the same real Maxi PDF against deployed v5: 15 clean deals (chicken thighs $1.99/lb, avocados 97¢), shrimp correctly dropped, zero absurd per-gram prices.
- Note for users with the bad extraction persisted: re-upload the flyer to replace the store's overlay deals.
- Tests: 154 → 159 (exact-repro cases incl. "brochette"/"each"/"300g" variants). Pipeline: code-builder → reviewer (pass). Edge function v5 deployed.

## 2026-07-23 — Bug fix: real flyer PDFs rejected by 10 MB cap
- Reported: uploads of real circulaires (Maxi 12.1 MB, IGA 10.7 MB, Super C 13.4 MB) failed with the misleading "Couldn't read this file" error.
- Root cause: 10 MB size cap on both client (MAX_FILE_BYTES) and edge function (MAX_BASE64_CHARS), calibrated to demo files — and the size rejection reused the 'unreadable_file' reason, so the UI blamed the file type.
- Fix: cap raised to 20 MB decoded on both sides (base64 ≈ 27 MB, safely under Anthropic's 32 MB request limit); new 'file_too_large' failure reason with honest copy; FlyerExtractionFailure union now runtime-enumerable with an exhaustiveness test on the copy map; MockFlyerExtractor given identical semantics.
- Verified end-to-end with the real 13.4 MB Super C circulaire against deployed extract-flyer v4: HTTP 200 in 119 s, 25 correct deals (chicken legs $1.95/lb, corn 50¢/unit, Exceldor chicken $8.99/lb — all match the printed flyer). Known risk noted: 119 s is close to the free-plan 150 s wall clock; larger flyers may need pagination later.
- Tests: 148 → 154. Pipeline: diagnosis → code-builder → reviewer (pass). Edge function v4 deployed via MCP.

## 2026-07-23 — Real DiscoveryAgent: live Montreal prices, no upload needed (Phase 0.5 COMPLETE)
- Requested: "Complete Phase 0.5" (plus a memory-rule change: devlog after every prompt).
- Data source pivot, validated by spike before building: Flipp's consumer backend (backflipp.wishabi.com) is directly reachable from BOTH local and the Supabase edge runtime — all 6 target chains carry current-week H4A circulaires with item-level prices. Pilot goes direct (browser UA, polite volume); the Apify managed scraper from the Phase 0 decision stays as the documented fallback seam. No Apify account needed.
- New `discover-deals` edge function (deployed v2): POST postal → Flipp flyers list → one synthesized store per target chain → per-ingredient item searches (56 non-staple, concurrency 8, failures tolerated) → prefilter (target flyers only, ≤10-day validity to kill month-long promos, non-food skip, cap 12/search) → ONE claude-opus-4-8 structured-outputs call whose only job is candidate→ingredient matching (derivatives like wings≠chicken_breast rejected) → deterministic mapDeals: unit parsing from Flipp's post_price_text (/lb, /kg, /100 g÷100), package fallback, prices/labels/dates never taken from the model.
- **Live-verification bug #2 of the day (critical):** package-priced fish ("crevettes $12.99" with no unit text) was emitted as unit 'unit' while shrimp's canonical unit is grams — the client PricingResolver passes mass↔non-mass through raw, so $12.99/package became $12.99/GRAM → a $1,208 shrimp meal and $13,380 weekly cost. Fix: server-side unit-correctness gate — only emit deals whose unit exactly matches the ingredient's canonical unit or is mass↔mass convertible. Cost-correctness > deal count (91 → 83 deals). Regenerated plan: $168.52/week for 4 people, meals $14.67–$26.99. Sane.
- Shared weekly cache: new `deal_cache` table (PK (FSA, Thu–Wed week_of), RLS on, service-role only) — first user's ~90s live discovery warms the area for everyone (verified: same-FSA second call 0.6s). Non-Montreal postals fail loudly (422). Reviewer caught a cached-postal stamping nit (same-FSA neighbour saw the original requester's postal) — fixed in both remote and mock agents + test.
- Client `RemoteDiscoveryAgent` behind the existing DiscoveryAgent seam (local 7-day cache, synthetic 3-phase progress, store_found events, failed-then-throw matching the mock exactly), `discoveryAgent` env factory (mock for Jest/no-env, EXPO_PUBLIC_DISCOVERY=mock escape hatch), DiscoveryError extracted, provenance 'discovered' added (additive), chain-level addStore dedupe.
- Verified end-to-end in browser: fresh onboarding → 6 REAL stores with real deal counts → skip upload → plan generated from this week's actual circulaire prices. label_mappings dictionary now learning from discovery too.
- Known accepted limitations (pilot): placeholder store distances (Flipp gives none), pre-switch flyer uploads keyed to old mock store ids no longer overlay, per-lb produce with per-unit canonical units (tomatoes) dropped by the unit gate.
- Tests: 96 → 148 (another session added 7 in parallel; this build added the rest). Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (2 minor findings, both fixed). Deployed via MCP; throwaway probe function retired to a 410 stub.

## 2026-07-23 — Real Claude-backed flyer extractor (Phase 0.5, first half)
- MockFlyerExtractor swapped for the real thing: new `extract-flyer` Supabase edge function (deployed, v3) runs claude-opus-4-8 with structured outputs over the uploaded PDF/PNG/JPEG — French-fluent prompt embeds the 70-ingredient catalog, ingredientId constrained to catalog ids via schema enum.
- Model output is never trusted raw: server-side validator (Jest-tested, shared pure module) drops unknown ids, clamps sale ≤ regular, falls back regular=sale (no invented savings), converts Quebec per-100g fish pricing to the app's per-gram convention (÷100, deterministic — found live when salmon came back 100× high), rounds to 4 decimals, defaults dates to the Mon–Sun week, dedupes per ingredient keeping cheapest, stamps id/storeId/provenance:'extracted'. Empty after filtering → loud `no_deals_found`.
- Client `RemoteFlyerExtractor` behind the existing FlyerExtractor seam: blob→base64, POST with anon key, synthetic progress ramp, 180s timeout, 10MB fail-fast, error-reason mapping. Env-driven factory (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/_ANON_KEY`) picks remote; Jest and no-env builds keep the mock. Browser-only bug found in live verification: unbound `fetch` throws "Illegal invocation" — fixed with `fetch.bind(globalThis)` (mock-based tests can't catch this class of bug).
- Accumulating French label→ingredient dictionary is live: new `label_mappings` table (RLS on, service-role only), fire-and-forget upsert after each successful extraction — 9 mappings recorded from the first real run.
- Verified end-to-end: curl with a generated French Super C flyer (9/9 food deals, detergent skipped, flyer dates parsed, ~10–19s) AND full in-browser flow (drop → visible progress → confirm/edit panel → apply → overlay persisted, seeded Super C deals replaced with provenance 'extracted').
- Tests: 67 → 96. Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (pass; reviewer's one minor finding — client-side size pre-check — applied).
- Deployed site now uses the real extractor (deploy.yml exports the public Supabase config at export time).

## 2026-07-23 — "Add a store" from the Shopping List
- Requested: a way to add an area store directly from the Shopping List (previously onboarding-only).
- Dashed "Add a store" row after the last store group → modal listing addable chains (shared `addableChains` helper with onboarding) → `addStoreAndSelect` appends the store's deals AND persists it into selected stores (without which pricing ignores it — scoper caught this).
- Fixed a real reactivity bug: the list memo never recomputed after store changes (deps didn't subscribe to discovery/prefs state). Verified live: adding Walmart re-routed Bell Peppers to its cheaper sale price instantly ($9.60 → $7.12).
- Plan totals intentionally stay as-generated; transient banner suggests regenerating. Checklist state preserved for non-re-routed rows.
- Tests +7 (addStoreFromList.test.ts). Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer. Reviewer flagged working-tree entanglement with the parallel discover-deals session's uncommitted edits — resolved by surgically committing only this feature's hunks (the import-swap hunk and parallel files stay uncommitted for that session to land).

## 2026-07-23 — Supabase provisioned (setup)
- Project "Flyer 2 Table" created (ref dnkzhrladfjuyvwnhxrb); ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set as an Edge Function secret (dashboard-verified); Supabase MCP added to project config and OAuth-authenticated; official Supabase agent skills installed.
- Everything is staged for Phase 0.5 (real Claude-backed FlyerExtractor) — build starts in the next session, where the MCP tools load.

## 2026-07-23 — "Bring Your Own Flyer" hybrid discovery (MVP upload path)
- Product decision (brainstormed): sidestep scraping/legal entirely for the pilot — user downloads their own weekly flyer (per-store links) and uploads it (PDF/PNG/JPG); extraction behind a new swappable `FlyerExtractor` seam. Mock extractor ships now; real Claude extraction arrives via Supabase edge function later (API key can't live in a static site).
- New onboarding step 4 of 5 "Bring Your Own Flyer": per-store download links, drag-and-drop upload slots, per-file progress + loud failures, confirm/edit panel (editable sale price clamped ≤ regular, include toggles, remove) before deals apply. Upload always optional — demo prices remain the fallback.
- Uploaded deals REPLACE that store's seeded deals, persist via a separately-versioned overlay (`ftt:flyerOverlay:v1`), and survive reload + forced re-discovery (never silently dropped). Deal provenance tracked (seeded/extracted/edited) — doubles as labeled data for measuring real extraction quality later.
- Verified in-browser end-to-end: drop → confirm → apply → v2 cache shows replaced deals, clamp enforced, overlay persisted without blob URIs.
- Tests: 55 → 67. Pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (pass, zero findings).
- Next: Supabase project + Anthropic API key → swap MockFlyerExtractor for the real Claude-backed edge function.

## 2026-07-23 — Phase 0 flyer-discovery spike (Montreal) — COMPLETE
- Ran the Montreal data-sourcing spike (research, not code): 6 parallel research agents — one per chain plus aggregators/legal.
- **Exit criteria MET**: all 5 target chains have structured/semi-structured weekly data (well past the 3-of-5 bar). Scores: IGA 4/5, Metro/Super C/Provigo/Maxi 3/5, Walmart 2/5.
- Key findings: data is more structured than feared (JSON APIs / HTML price attributes, not just images); French fully solved (all bilingual + Claude fluent); uniform Thu–Wed cadence. Real obstacles are bot protection (Akamai/Cloudflare/PerimeterX) and uniform "personal, non-commercial use" ToS (gray zone under Canadian browsewrap case law — needs a legal read before production).
- **Decision: Flipp-first hybrid.** Pilot sources real data via a managed Flipp aggregator scraper (Apify, ~$5/1k results, covers all 6 chains, one schema); Claude extraction stays for PDF fallback + French label→ingredient mapping (accumulating dictionary in Postgres); send Flipp NativeX partnership inquiry; keep per-retailer scraping as documented fallback.
- Full writeup: `Reference Files/phase0-flyer-discovery-findings.md` (kept private, not in public repo).
- Resolves the "Flyer data sourcing approach" open question. Unblocks Phase 0.5 (real DiscoveryAgent + Supabase).

## 2026-07-23 — Unit model (kg/lb), CAD currency, flyer corroboration links
- Proper mass-unit domain model (`g`/`kg`/`lb`, 1 lb = 453.592 g): meats now seeded and displayed per-lb like real Quebec flyers ($8.99/lb · $19.82/kg dual display), fish keep per-100 g convention.
- Fixed a latent bug: cost math multiplied quantity × unit price with no unit check; deal comparison now normalizes per-gram so mixed-unit deals compare like-for-like.
- All money rendering goes through one CAD formatter (en-CA); "All prices in CAD" notes on shopping list, specials modal, and share export.
- Store specials modal deals link out to the chain's real public flyer page (superc.ca, metro.ca, iga.net, provigo.ca, maxi.ca, loblaws.ca, walmart.ca) for visual price corroboration; "View full flyer" footer button.
- Discovery cache bumped to v2 so stale old-unit deals can't mix with new math.
- Follow-up fix (found in browser verification): "Generate Meal Plan" silently no-op'd when discovery data was missing (expired/invalidated cache); now routes into the visible discovery flow instead.
- Tests: 39 → 55. Recovery flow verified in browser (dead button now re-runs discovery; added stores re-merge correctly).

## 2026-07-23 — Four UI enhancements (pushed: 827526e)
- Onboarding step dots are tappable with flanking left/right arrows; unreachable steps gated on real state; transient discovery step skipped.
- "Add more stores" on Select Stores: full chain catalog incl. new Loblaws and Walmart chains, each with seeded deals; added stores persist and survive re-discovery.
- Shopping list store names open a "This week's flyer specials" modal (sale vs regular, discount %, validity, sorted by depth).
- Per-unit cost shown on every shopping list row (per-100 g for gram-priced items).
- Tests: 21 → 39.

## 2026-07-23 — GitHub + live deployment
- Public repo github.com/thejonho88/flyer-to-table (Reference Files/ deliberately excluded — product spec stays private).
- GitHub Actions workflow: on push to main → run tests → Expo static export → deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Live at https://thejonho88.github.io/flyer-to-table/
- Standing rule adopted: after each completed change set, commit + push (auto-redeploys).

## 2026-07-23 — Montreal-wide postal coverage (pushed: efb918e, amended)
- Any H-prefix FSA now resolves to seeded flyer data (deterministic hash onto 5 seeded areas, per-FSA distance jitter); pilot user's H4A 2Z9 verified working.
- Non-H postal codes still hit the loud "No local flyers found" state.
- Tests: 18 → 21.

## 2026-07-22 — Phase 1 Web MVP built (pushed: efb918e)
- Full P0 scope on Expo + React Native Web + TypeScript: postal entry → mock discovery agent (progress events, 7-day cache, loud failure) → store selection → preferences (hard dietary/cook-time constraints, leftovers scaling) → sale-weighted 5–7 dinner plan → per-store shopping list (staples excluded by default) → single-meal swap.
- All external dependencies behind swappable interfaces (DiscoveryAgent, RecipeSource, PersistenceAdapter) — Supabase and the real discovery agent slot in later without touching the planner/UI.
- 29 seeded recipes (guaranteed coverage for strictest constraint combos), 5 seeded Montreal chains, CAD mock pricing.
- 18 unit tests; pipeline: scoper → code-builder → reviewer (passed).

## Backlog / not done
- **Phase 0 flyer-discovery spike: DONE (2026-07-23)** — decision is Flipp-first hybrid; see the dated entry above and `Reference Files/phase0-flyer-discovery-findings.md`.
- **Phase 0.5 — real DiscoveryAgent: DONE (2026-07-23)** — both halves live: Claude flyer extraction (uploads) AND Flipp-backed discovery (real Montreal prices with no upload; shared weekly deal cache + accumulating label dictionary in Postgres). See the two dated entries above. Follow-ups moved to open items below.
- Flipp data-path hardening (post-pilot): the direct backflipp dependency is undocumented and could break/block — keep the Apify managed-scraper fallback ready; send the Flipp NativeX partnership inquiry; real store locations/distances (Flipp gives none — currently placeholders); consider re-admitting per-lb produce deals via package-weight assumptions (tomatoes currently dropped by the unit-correctness gate).
- Get a legal read on the chains' "personal, non-commercial use" terms before production scale-up.
- Business model decision (needed before Phase 2 monetization work).
- Recipe database: build vs license decision.
- Real recipe images (placeholder art currently).
- Packaging-aware quantity display (e.g. "10 bunch broccoli" reads oddly for large households).
